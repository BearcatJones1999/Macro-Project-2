# Macro-Project-2
This project analyzed economic growth using the Solow Growth Model and an intertemporal optimization problem, focusing on U.S. data from the Penn World Trade Database. We decomposed output growth into contributions from capital, labor, and total factor productivity (TFP) using the Cobb-Douglas production function and observed key historical trends, such as post-war expansion, stagflation, and the tech boom. We calibrated the Solow model with real-world parameters and simulated the path of capital per worker, finding that while the model captured general trends, it underestimated actual GDP due to fixed parameters and missing factors like human capital and technological shocks. Sensitivity analysis showed that changes in savings rates, depreciation, and productivity significantly influenced capital accumulation and long-run output. The intertemporal optimization problem reinforced standard economic behavior, where individuals allocate consumption across time based on discounting and interest rates, with higher future returns encouraging savings. The model’s limitations highlight the need for dynamic parameters to better capture real-world economic fluctuations.

To replicate this analysis, first download the Penn World Trade Database and extract data for real GDP (rgdpo), capital stock (rnna), and labor force (emp) for the USA. Load the dataset into Python using Pandas and clean it by filtering for the USA and handling missing values. Compute the Solow residual (TFP) using the Cobb-Douglas production function and normalize it to 1 in 1980. Calibrate the Solow model by setting parameters for capital elasticity, savings rate , and depreciation rate , then calculate capital per worker  and simulate its path over time. Compare the simulated GDP to actual GDP and analyze discrepancies. Perform sensitivity analysis to see how they affect capital and output. Solve the intertemporal optimization problem using Python’s `scipy.optimize` to find optimal savings and consumption across two periods. Finally, visualize the results using Matplotlib and interpret trends. Running the full Python script with the dataset will replicate the results.
